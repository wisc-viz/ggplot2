#### Faceted scatterplot
Here's a graphic we collectively produced in ggplot2 that incorporates this week's topics. The code to produce the plot is in the code directory:

![a plot demonstrating ggplot2, faceting, dot sizing, colors, and the bw theme](https://raw.github.com/wisc-viz/ggplot2/master/basics/img/runoff.png)

##### Topics from this week:
 - Using `qplot` to make a quick scatterplot
 - Faceting with `facet_wrap`
 - The bw theme to remove the grayscale background and make an image better suited for plotting
 - Setting the aspect ratio for each facet with `theme(aspect.ratio=1)`
 - Controlling dot size (`size` argument of `qplot`)
 - Controlling dot color (`color` argument of `qplot`)
